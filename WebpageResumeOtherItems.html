    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>I love a challenge, trying new things, and learning. I attend various tech events out of pure curiosity and interest. Someday, I would love to become an efficient programmer.</p>
    <p> Also, I love sports and being active. Last year I ran my first two half marathons and completed my first triathlon sprint. For 2015, it is my goal to complete a full marathon and full triathlon. In the winter, I love to snowboard. When the weather is nice, I like to swim, bike, or run.</p>
