    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>I love a challenge, trying new things, and learning. I attend various tech events and workshops out of pure curiosity and interest in self-development.</p>
    <p> I also love sports and being active. I have completed a triathlon sprint and three half marathons including one that took place on The Great Wall of China. I like to run, swim, bike, and play ultimate frisbee. In the winter, I enjoying snowboarding with friends, even if they ski.</p>
