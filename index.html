      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I worked in the legal field for three years. While law was interesting, I have since decided I would rather spend my time pursing my dreams of working in tech and creating something great. I love the innovation and fast paced atmosphere of startups. I like the competition and need to be the best. I have acquired a foundation of tech related skills from various tech workshops and events that I have attended. I have also obtained such skills through the heavy reliance of tech at my current position, as well as in my day-to-day life.
</p>
<p>
      I take pride in producing quality work and believe it is reflection of who I am. I enjoy being part of a team and I am happy to accept help, guidance, and instruction from others. When appropriate, I am a strong leader and not afraid to take initiative. I believe open, and respectful, communication is essential to the well-being of every success company.
